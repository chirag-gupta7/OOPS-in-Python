# OOPS-in-Python
Python OOP Examples: Stock Analysis & Pokédex

Demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python through practical examples. Features a Pokédex class system for managing Pokemon data and stock analysis functions. Includes bank account management, terminal RPG game, and interactive programs showcasing classes, methods, inheritance, and data encapsulation.

# Python Object-Oriented Programming Examples

This repository demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python through practical, real-world examples including a Pokédex system and stock analysis tools.

## 🚀 Features

### Core OOP Examples
- **Pokédex System** ([pokedex.py](pokedex.py)) - Pokemon class with attributes and methods
- **Bank Account Management** ([bank_account.py](bank_account.py)) - Financial account operations
- **Stock Analysis Tools** ([stock_analysis.py](stock_analysis.py)) - Market data analysis functions

### Interactive Programs
- **Terminal RPG Game** ([terminal_game.py](terminal_game.py)) - Text-based adventure game
- **Drive-Thru Simulator** ([drive_thru.py](drive_thru.py)) - Fast food ordering system
- **Fortune Cookie Generator** ([first_function.py](first_function.py)) - Random fortune dispenser

## 📁 File Structure

```

## 🎯 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

### Classes and Objects
- [`Pokemon`](pokedex.py) class with constructor and instance methods
- [`BankAccount`](bank_account.py) class with financial operations

### Methods and Attributes
- Instance methods: `speak()`, `display_detail()`, `deposit()`, `withdraw()`
- Attribute management and data encapsulation
- Method chaining and return values

### Practical Applications
- Stock price analysis with [`price_at()`](stock_analysis.py), [`max_price()`](stock_analysis.py), [`min_price()`](stock_analysis.py)
- Pokemon data management and caught status tracking
- Account balance operations with validation

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd python-oop-examples

# Run individual examples
python pokedex.py
python stock_analysis.py
python terminal_game.py
```

## 💡 Key Learning Points

- **Encapsulation**: Data and methods bundled within classes
- **Instance Methods**: Functions that operate on object data
- **Constructor Pattern**: `__init__` method for object initialization
- **Error Handling**: Input validation and exception management
- **Function Design**: Modular programming with clear interfaces

Perfect for beginners learning Python OOP concepts through hands-on examples!
